# Sasank's dotfiles

This is handled using GNU Stow, primarily inspired by Dreams of Code through [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6XCebnB9gs).




## Things I've customized

Terminal: zsh
oh-my-zsh
Tmux
Tmux config is self-written for desktop but for laptop and cluster I use oh-my-tmux.
Neovim
Neovim config is NVChad. Here, I've only included the custom files, as the other files are handled by NVChad.
Emacs - I don't use Emacs that often though I should look into it more.
Emacs config is Doom Emacs
