# Notes (and todos)

Doom config stored in different places
I want to move desktop to ~/.config/doom/ like my laptop has it

Tmux config very different between laptop and desktop
Need to add tmux to stow ignore for now I think
I think the only things bad about oh-my-tmux are that I can't get full vim-style pane switching and that oh-my-tmux takes so long to load

nvim source is different between laptop and desktop

Neofetch configs are somehow different in the parts different from user option arguments??? (I actually don't have any user arguments in the proper config)
TODO: Laptop Neofetch seems to be latest version at 7.1.0
Ensure that desktop is updated to that as well
TODO: Also, use the laptop config since I am more sure that it is updated.
TODO: config the neofetch from the proper config file instead of just fixing command line arguments in the .zshrc lol

I got some real jank thing going with the tmux stows.
Also, I don't have npm on my laptop so CoPilot is screwed.
